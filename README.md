# Work: Block B - Heritance

8INF957: Advanced object programming

Original french instructions file can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deguilardi/uqac-8INF957-travail-2/main/assets/travail_bloc_B_WARP.pdf).

## Instructions

* Teamwork of 1 or 2
* Submission date: week 6 (October 27)
* Language: Java
* send on MS Teams
  * A single project, compiled and functional
  * The class diagram of your solution

## The "Warp"

We are in the 41st century, and humanity roams space and has encountered plenty of alien races.
An intangible dimension, called the Warp, has also been discovered and is being exploited by several races.
It is populated by powerful entities that offer listening, power and knowledge to beings worthy of their attention.

### There are several major breeds

* Human "Psykers" Communicate with their God-emperor "empereur-Dieu"
* The "Harlequins" worship "Cegorach", the mocking god
* "Orks" fight for twin gods "Gork et Mork"
* "Tyranids" are linked by a synaptic link to the beehive spirit "l'espirit de la ruche"
* Agents of "Chaos" Worship "Khorne", the God of War

### Each breed worship the Warp their own ways and in a different forms.

### Warp entities perform the following tasks for their followers

* Provide advice without particular reason
* Provide advice based on a demand
* Perform miracles
* Listening to needs without responding
* Listen to needs and respond as an advice
* Listen to needs and perform a miracle
* Etc (add 3 other tasks for your work)

## How it works

From the “Singleton” design pattern provided in the discipline's block A (see GoF project), design and program three races (choose from the five available) and invent one of your own.

*"MonServeur" is the Warp
* The Services are: Advice, Miracle, Listening and <another of your choice>
* Each race can access the Warp with their hand.
* The Warp package can only contain Warp, Services and Interfaces
* Use the hand to test your solution

### Friend's advices

* This project is fairly straightforward if you take the trouble to read and fully understand the provided project. Not just reading the code, understanding every subtlety.
* Then, when you have understood the base, you can adapt the code (and of course give meaningful class names)
